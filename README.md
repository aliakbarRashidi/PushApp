# PushApp
This is a very simple app to demonstrate registering a device token and
receiving push notifications from FCM and APNs on a Qt app that runs on both
Android and iOS.

This is using Qt 5.8, Android-25 (I think), and iOS 10.

It's the companion source to [Push Notifications in qt for ios and android](https://medium.com/@shigmas/push-notifications-in-qt-for-ios-and-android-50c2f9a38444)
